# Confirm Payment

**POST** `https://api.monei.com/v1/payments/:id/confirm`

Confirms a payment that was created without payment details. This endpoint can only be used with payments in **PENDING** status.

The two-step payment flow:

1. **Create**: First, create a payment without payment details (status: PENDING)
2. **Confirm**: Then provide payment details to complete the transaction

When confirming a payment, you can use:

- A newly generated `paymentToken` from **monei.js Components**
- A permanent `paymentToken` from a previous payment (generated with `generatePaymentToken: true`)

Using permanent payment tokens enables one-click checkout experiences for returning customers without requiring them to re-enter their payment information.

You can provide additional customer information during confirmation, which will override any corresponding information originally passed in the payment creation request.
